# Crop-Recommendation-system
India is an agricultural country as which is well known for agriculture in the world. 
Agriculture is major field in the world and it is also known as backbone of India. Most of the population and economy in India involved in agriculture.
Farmers aware of traditional farming and unaware of climatic conditions influence the crop production and leads to great loss. These risks can be reduced by applying machine learning model. 
Thus, our solution to solve the problem is building recommender system based on climatic conditions like temperature, N, P, K, Ph, rainfall and humidity to decide the right crop.
Our main aim is to predict multiple crops. In this paper, using machine learning approach like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree to predict which crop is best.
